# How to add a new blog post

1. Create a new folder in the `blog` directory with the name of the blog post.
2. Add a `content.md` file to the folder with the content of the blog post.
3. Add images to the folder and then reference them in the Markdown file.
4. Add the folder to  `posts.json` file in the `blog` directory.

Notes:
- The `posts.json` file is used to generate the blog posts on the homepage.
- The `content.md` file is the main content of the blog post. IT also contains the metadata to be displayed in the blog post card.
